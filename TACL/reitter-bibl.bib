In this model, two well-established {ACT}-R mechanisms, base-level learning and spreading activation, account for long-term adaptation and short-term priming, respectively. Our model simulates incremental language production and in a series of modeling studies we show that it accounts for (a) the inverse frequency interaction; (b) the absence of a decay in long-term priming; and (c) the cumulativity of long-term adaptation. The model also explains the lexical boost effect and the fact that it only applies to short-term priming.

We present two studies that test these explanations by investigating priming effects in a dialogue corpus. We compare syntactic constituents with distituents, i.e., part-of-speech pairs that cross constituent boundaries. We find a reliable short-term priming effect for constituents, but no priming for distituents. This result supports the rule-based view of priming, which does not predict priming of distituents. The data are incompatible with a sequence priming analysis, which cannot distinguish between constituents and distituents. In a second corpus study, we study long-term priming and find priming effects for both constituents and distituents. This indicates that the mechanism underlying long-term adaptation differs substantially from short-term priming.},

The Interactive Alignment Model (Pickering and Garrod, 2004) suggests that this convergence is the result of an interactive alignment process, which is based on mechanistic repetition at a number of linguistic levels.  In this paper, we develop two predictions arising from the theory, along with two methods to quantify the known structural priming effects in the full inventory of syntactic choices found in text and speech corpora.  (a) Under a rational perspective, we expect increased repetition in task-oriented dialogue compared to spontaneous conversation.  We find within- and between-speaker priming in a corpus of spontaneous conversations, but stronger priming in task-oriented dialogue.  (b) The Interactive Alignment Model predicts linguistic adaptation to be correlated with task success.  We show this effect in a corpus of task-oriented dialogue, where we find a positive correlation of long-term adaptation and a quantifiable task success measure.  We argue that the repetition tendency relevant for the high-level alignment of situation models is based on slow adaptation rather than short-term priming.  We demonstrate that lexical and syntactic repetition are reliable and computationally exploitable predictors of task success.},

	title = {Context effects in language production: models of syntactic priming in dialogue corpora},
	url = {http://www.david-reitter.com/pub/reitter2008phd.pdf},
	abstract = {This thesis addresses the cognitive basis of syntactic adaptation, which biases speakers to repeat their own syntactic constructions and those of their conversational partners. I address two types of syntactic adaptation: short-term priming and long-term adaptation. I develop two metrics for syntactic adaptation within a speaker and between speakers in dialogue: one for short-term priming effects that decay quickly, and one for long-term adaptation over the course of a dialogue. Both methods estimate adaptation in large datasets consisting of transcribed human-human dialogue annotated with syntactic information. Two such corpora in English are used: Switchboard, a collection of spontaneous phone conversation, and {HCRC} Map Task, a set of task-oriented dialogues in which participants describe routes on a map to each other. I find both priming and long-term adaptation in both corpora, confirming well-known experimental results (Bock, 1986). I extend prior work by showing that syntactic priming effects not only apply to selected syntactic constructions that are alternative realizations of the same semantics, but still hold when a broad variety of syntactic phrase-structure rules are considered. Each rule represents a cognitive decision during syntactic processing. I show that the priming effect for a rule is inversely proportional to its frequency. With this methodology, I test predictions of the Interactive Alignment Model (Pickering \& Garrod, 2004). The {IAM} claims that linguistic and situation-model agreement between interlocutors in dialogue is the result of a cascade of resource-free, mechanistic priming effects on various linguistic levels. I examine task-oriented dialogue in Map Task, which provides a measure of task success through the deviance of the communicated routes on the maps. I find that long-term syntactic adaptation predicts communicative success, and it does so earlier than lexical adaptation. The result is applied in a machine-learning based model that estimates task success based on the dialogue, capturing 14 percent of the variance in Map Task. Short-term syntactic priming differs qualitatively from long-term adaptation, as it does not predict task success, providing evidence against learning as a single cognitive basis of adaptation effects. I obtain further evidence for the correlation between semantic activity and syntactic priming through a comparison of the Map Task and Switchboard corpora, showing that short-term priming is stronger in task-oriented dialogue than in spontaneous conversation. This difference is evident for priming between and within speakers, which suggests that priming is a mechanistic rather than strategic effect. I turn to an investigation of the level at which syntactic priming influences language production. I establish that the effect applies to structural syntactic decisions as opposed to all surface sequences of lexical categories. To do so, I identify pairs of part-of-speech categories which consistently cross constituent boundaries defined by the phrase-structure analyses of the sentences. I show that such distituents are less sensitive to priming than pairs occurring within constituents. Thus, syntactic priming is sensitive to syntactic structure. The notion of constituent structure differs among syntactic models. Combinatory Categorial Grammar ({CCG}, Steedman, 2000) formalizes flexible constituent structure, accounting a varying degree of incrementality in syntactic sentence planning. I examine whether priming effects can support the predictions of {CCG} using the Switchboard corpus, which has been annotated with {CCG} syntax. I confirm the syntactic priming effect for lexical and non-lexical {CCG} categories, which encode partially satisfied subcategorization frames. I then show that both incremental and normal-form constituent structures exhibit priming, arguing for language production accounts that support flexible incrementality. The empirical results are reflected in a cognitive model of syntactic realization in language production. The model assumes that language production is subject to the same principles and constraints as any other form of cognition and follows the {ACT}-R framework (Anderson, 2004). Its syntactic process implements my empirical results on priming and is based on {CCG}. Syntactic planning can take place incrementally and non-incrementally. The model is able to generate simple sentences that vary syntactically, similar to the materials used in the experimental priming literature. Syntactic adaptation emerges due to a preferential and sped-up memory retrieval of syntactic categories describing linearization and subcategorization requirements. Long-term adaptation is explained as a form of learning, while short-term priming is the result of a combination of learning and spreading activation from semantic and lexical material. Simulations show that the model produces the adaptation effects and their inverse frequency interaction, as well as cumulativity of long-term adaptation.},

We analyzed a corpus of human-human tutoring dialogues, focusing on three areas important to system development: interleaved symbolic and natural language, domain modeling, and tutorial dialogue strategies. We provide empirical verification of previous results on interleaving natural and symbolic language, and show that the properties of interleaving are highly dependent on the input modality. We describe a task model for our domain, and provide corpus data to show that the model must cover basic algebra skills as well, which are involved in differentiation. We verify the applicability of an existing annotation scheme for tutoring algebra in our domain, and propose that it be extended to cover student initiative.},

Empirical data show that human communicators can evolve graphical languages quickly in a constrained task (Pictionary), and that communities converge towards a common language. We propose that simulations of such cultural evolution incorporate properties of human memory (cue-based retrieval, learning, decay). A cognitive model is described that encodes abstract concepts with small sets of concrete, related concepts (directing), and that also decodes such signs (matching). Learning captures conventionalized signs. Relatedness of concepts is characterized by a mixture of shared and individual knowledge, which we sample from a text corpus. Simulations show vocabulary convergence of agent communities of varied structure, but idiosyncrasy in vocabularies of each dyad of models. Convergence is weakened when agents do not alternate between encoding and decoding, predicting the necessity of bi-directional communication. Convergence is improved by explicit feedback about communicative success. We hypothesize that humans seek out subtle clues to gauge success in order to guide their vocabulary acquisition.},

Examples of such decisions include when to check log files for intruders and when to monitor financial accounts for fraud or errors. To better understand how performance in timing-related security situations is shaped by individuals' cognitive predispositions, we effectively combine survey measures with economic experiments.  Two behavioral experiments are presented in which the timing of online security actions is the critical decision-making factor. The feedback modality in the decision-environment is varied between visual feedback with history (Experiment 1), and temporal feedback without history (Experiment 2).  Using psychometric scales, we study the role of individual difference variables, specifically risk propensity and need for cognition.  The analysis is based on the data from over 450 participants.  We find that risk propensity is not a hindrance in timing tasks.  Participants of average risk propensity generally benefit from a reflective disposition (high need for cognition), particularly when visual feedback is given.  Overall, participants benefit from need for cognition; however, in the more difficult, temporal-estimation task, this requires familiarity with the task.},

This design provides an experimental model of human communities, where information may spread from peer to peer by word of mouth. With this model, we explain the realistic tradeoff between liberal information dumping and targeted information sharing by human peers. Human subjects exchanged natural-language messages with relevance to a task, thereby sharing knowledge across a community. Communication took place along the edges of a small-world graph. Cooperation and individual efforts were incentivized. In one condition, participants were asked to request specific information and only supply information that they knew was needed. In another condition, they were asked to supply and forward as much information as possible. We found that a targeted communication policy was successfully implemented by the participants, increased task success, shortened the time it took to get answers to questions, increased efficiency (task success per communication bandwidth), and may have done so selectively for nodes with fewer connections.},

	url = {http://www.david-reitter.com/pub/reitter2004hybrid-multimodal-generation_compressed.pdf},
	abstract = {The output of multimodal human-computer interfaces is what this thesis is concerned with. Rather than hard-coding graphical and spoken representations, methods are introduced that plan and realize coherent output, appropriate to the situation and the device. The generation system expects a mode- and language-independent representation, as it can be supplied by the dialogue management component of a dialogue system. The generator then assembles mode-specific rendering instructions simultaneously for each mode with the aid of a unification-based functional grammar. The approach proposed in this thesis abandons the canonical structure of pipelined planning and realization in natural language generation, in favor of hard constraints formulated in a grammar, and soft constraints that allow for the gradual adaptivity of the output. The grammar is constructed to ensure the coherence of output in different modalities, whose output is generated in a synchronized fashion rather than by separate, mode-specific generators. The soft constraints follow some of the Gricean maxims by incorporating two counteracting communicative goals: efficacy and efficiency. A fitness function encoding these goals takes into account situation- and user-specific factors, such as distractions in a single mode or the user's sensory impairments. The function leads to the selection of an appropriate output from the variety of potential outputs generated by the grammar. It is evaluated in a study with human subjects. The thesis presents a unification based, hybrid grammar formalism which can combine pre-fabricated phrases and linguistically motivated grammar fragments, and an associated algorithm which integrates the formulation of grammars that lead to cross-modally coherent output. Methods are compared to efficiently implement a control strategy, combining hard and soft constraints as a constraint optimization problem. The cross-modal coherence implemented by the grammar formalism is motivated by known phenomena, such as cross-modal priming, or alignment between interlocutors. To optimize discourse coherence, central ideas of Centering Theory are implemented using the grammar formalism. Finally, novel methods and a ready-to-use implementation are introduced which allow user interface developers to inspect, maintain and extend grammars. The formalism and generation implementation is demonstrated with a grammar for a mobile, multimodal application, the Virtual Personal Assistant.},

We examine risk propensity as a personal preference affecting timing decisions and document a bias, impatience.  Experiment 1 analyzes people's strategy in timing games in relation to a rational model.  Contrasting two cognitive models suggests that individuals apply risk propensity to the probability distributions underlying short games and when unfamiliar with the situation, but that, over time, impatience takes over as a linear adjustment.  In Experiment 2, impatient participants risk their incentive payment in order to play early, even if they receive no advantage from doing so.},

Alignment at lexical and syntactic levels, as well as decay of alignment was observed in forum threads, although the decay was slower than commonly found in psycholinguistic studies. The different pattern of adaptation to the initial post on a thread suggests that specific roles in the online forum (e.g., seeking support from the community) can potentially be revealed through alignment theory and its extensions.},

The model underspecifies other portions of the task strategies, whose timing was determined as unbiased estimate from empirical data. The model's predictions were evaluated on data collected from novel experimental conditions, which did not inform the model's development and included discontinuous and noisy environmental change functions and a control delay. The model as well as the data show sudden changes in subject error and general learning of control; the model also correctly predicted oscillations of plausible magnitude.

While adaptation can occur at lexical, syntactic and pragmatic levels, relationships between alignments at multiple levels are neither theoretically nor empirically well understood. Our
results indicate pragmatic alignment of forum members along the axis of support type. We also find that lexical alignment is correlated with emotional support, and that the amount of lexical alignment is also correlated with the amount of pragmatic alignment.  This finding can contribute to improving our
understanding about the linguistic signature of different types of support, and enhancing theoretical model of the Interactive Alignment Model in a multi-party peer support conversation context.},

	abstract = {The Lemonade Game is a three-player game in which players have to pick locations on a circular board, which are as far away as possible from those chosen independently by other players. Players may observe other player's moves and infer their strategies. The game was studied using a competition of cognitively motivated agents, which inherit properties of adaptivity and stochasticity from human memory and decision-making, and simplistic, yet effective agents implementing fixed strategies. We argue that metacognition is the unique attribute that allows sophisticated agents to adapt to unforeseen conditions, cooperators and competitors.},

	abstract = {Continuous games of timing represent an ecologically relevant case of decision-making under uncertainty with many applications to tactical security scenarios. We present two experiments collecting data using the two-player, 20-second {FlipIt} game, in which a player has to react to an estimated, externally controlled quantity in light of a continuous payoff distribution. The quantity is represented once as time interval, and once as distance in time and space. Risk-taking propensity is an individual parameter obtained via a standardized survey instrument. We find that risk propensity affects participants' decisions in early and late rounds of the game and show that risk-seeking individuals fail to play well initially in the difficult, time-interval estimation task, but that they can be trained to make rational choices. Participants' biases are gaussian-distributed. They do not reflect the distribution of payoffs or expected utility. We present an {ACT}-R model using established error distributions for temporal and visual perception and instance-based learning.},

	abstract = {Two information decay methods are examined that help multi-agent systems cope with dynamic environments. The agents in this simulation have human-like memory and a mechanism to moderate their communications: they forget internally stored information via temporal decay, and they forget distributed information by filtering it as it passes through a communication network. The agents play a foraging game, in which performance depends on communicating facts and requests and on storing facts in internal memory. Parameters of the game and agent models are tuned to human data. Agent groups with moderated communication in small-world networks achieve optimal performance for typical human memory decay values, while non-adaptive agents benefit from stronger memory decay. The decay and filtering strategies interact with the properties of the network graph in ways suggestive of an evolutionary co-optimization between the human cognitive system and an external social structure.},

	abstract = {We simulate the evolution of a domain language in small speaker communities. Data from experiments (Garrod et al., 2007; Fay et al., 2008) show that human communicators can evolve graphical languages quickly in a constrained task (Pictionary), and that communities converge towards a common language even in the absence of feedback about the success of each communication. We postulate that simulations of such horizontal evolution have to take into account properties of human memory (cue-based retrieval, learning, decay). We implement a model that can draw abstract concepts through sets of non-abstract, related concepts, and recognize such drawings. The knowledge base is a network with association strengths randomly sampled from a natural distribution found in a text corpus; it is a mixture of knowledge shared between agents and individual knowledge. In three experiments, we show that the agent communities converge, but that initial convergence is stronger when communities are structured so that the same pairs of agents interact throughout. Convergence is weaker in communities when agents do not swap roles (between recognizing and drawing), predicting the necessity of bi-directional communication in domain language evolution. Average and ultimate recognition performance depends on how much of the knowledge agents share initially.},
